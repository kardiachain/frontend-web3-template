# Template to work with KardiaChain using web3 js

This is a simple template to work with KardiaChain using `web3`. The custom hook `useWeb3` can be used to connect to KardiaChain Wallet extension or Metamask.

*Note*: This is only a minimal sample to demonstrate how to work with KardiaChain using RPC. Every other function still need to be built by yourself.
